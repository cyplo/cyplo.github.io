While doing so I needed to migrate away from using Netlify's internal build infrastructure. This resulted in a quick &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cyplo/netlify_deployer"&gt;python script&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to upload arbitrary directory tree to Netlify and does so using their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/api/#deploying-to-netlify"&gt;incremental deployment API&lt;/a&gt;. All that means that while this site is quite big in size the deployments go rather quickly ! There are some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cyplo/netlify_deployer/issues"&gt;known issues&lt;/a&gt; but apart from them the script should just work for any custom Netlify deployment you would like to have. I use it on this very site, to have a preview of any PR before merging it as well as for deploying the main site after the PR is merged. I hope you will find it useful and please do not hesitate if you want to post an issue or a PR !&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blog</category><category>deployment</category><category>netlify</category><category>python</category><guid>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2017/03/netlify-incremental-deployer.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 19:25:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
