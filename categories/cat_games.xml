times of Metropolis Software on. Naturally then, I am following really
closely on the development of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bulletstorm.com/"&gt;Bulletstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Damn, I even hoped to
talk to The Guy or Mieszko Zielinski at the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gameaiconf.com/"&gt;gameaiconf&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, but
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aigamedev.com/"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; told me that "whoa,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.peoplecanfly.com/"&gt;PCF&lt;/a&gt; is so busy with the new IP that
they didn't have time to come this year, next year they'll be here,
hopefully".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having something so deeply embedded in your mind that you're always
thinking of it. While you eat, while you talk, in your sleep. That's the
way I do like to work. Reading about making of Bulletstorm gives me
creeps as I do feel their hyperenthusiasm about the thing, I do feel
that they take this game everywhere with them. To dinner, breakfast,
party. That's the way I do like to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back on track, an interview which triggered this urge to flush my
thoughts here. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://techland.com/2010/10/14/origins-tanya-jessen-lead-producer-on-bulletstorm/"&gt;Interview with Tanya
Jessen&lt;/a&gt;,
producer at Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People make games so other people can have fun. How selfless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2010/10/15/bulletstorm.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2010 13:12:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
