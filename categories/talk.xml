The one from the
kind of spreading  knowledge on the safe internet usage to people not
necessarily of the tech background. This was my first one given to a
such audience and to add to it all, it was given in Polish. The biggest
challenge ? Finding good equivalent for the English tech terms. I think
the talks went quite okay and the discussion afterwards was quite
lively. I said a bit on how the internet works and what's wrong with
that, to transition later to what problems Tor addresses and which it
does not. I tried to emphasize that using Tor does not make you
automatically immune to the dangers of the internet. Big thanks to the
organizers, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://praxis.ue.wroc.pl/"&gt;Praxis&lt;/a&gt; student group from

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fabiankrol.com/"&gt;Fabian&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the generous support
from Infusion I was able to speak at Institute of Computer Science at
University of Wroclaw. The event was a blast, and that is an opinion of
the people other than me also ;) Thanks for everyone who was there and
