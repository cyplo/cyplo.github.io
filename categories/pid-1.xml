and found a curious issue there. Whenever Jenkins was polling the git
server the side effect was that it created a zombie ssh process. The
issue is actually
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/issues/54"&gt;remediated&lt;/a&gt; by the
Jenkins team now by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/commit/d5aea67dcae9d62fe4ca6ad961ffe66f65d9a591"&gt;explicitly
using&lt;/a&gt;
a tiny init system called ...
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/krallin/tini"&gt;tini,&lt;/a&gt; started as the main
container's process instead of just starting Jenkins there. This tiny
tini thing can properly adopt and reap the children. I was all like -
wow, what a great blog entry is coming at me. I was planning to describe
how zombies come to existence on Linux and why Docker should, in my
opinion, provide an adopter-reaper by default and other very interesting
things ! But then I found a really excellent article by the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.phusion.nl/"&gt;Phusion&lt;/a&gt; team
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
explaining all that and more. It is very good. You should read it. That
is it. The end. Happy reaping !&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>docker</category><category>init</category><category>jenkins</category><category>pid 1</category><category>reaper</category><category>zombie</category><guid>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2015/08/12/containerized-zombie-spawner.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 21:21:13 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
