&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/wrocnet/events/138787702/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. It was
on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://prezi.com/hzvnsznfkgwj/anatomy-of-the-debugger/"&gt;debuggers&lt;/a&gt;.
From VM-level debuggers to JTAG, quite a packed, high level overview. In
fact I gave it
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/KGD-NET/events/113593522/"&gt;before,&lt;/a&gt; on another
occasions. And this time was different, hence this post. The thing I am
particularly proud of is that I was able to entertain the crowd for the
first half of an hour despite not having any computer launched and
connected. You know, like, interacting with actual people ! We had some
difficulties connecting to a beamer so I thought it'd be good to have an
open discussion first. We've started with "unit tests vs debuggers". Is
having a rock solid unit tests suite enough for you to never touch a
debugger ? After some time I've transitioned to my presentation, talked
a bit about the history of debugging, then what are the features of
modern debuggers and finally how all of these work. And while we're at
it I would like to give a shout out to the organizers of these 2 events.
Thanks !&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>debugger</category><category>gdb</category><category>jtag</category><category>os</category><category>processor</category><guid>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2013/09/18/anatomy-debugger.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2013 17:26:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
