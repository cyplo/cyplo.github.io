provider I started my search for some other one. This time not only
google was involved but also &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vark.com/"&gt;aardvark&lt;/a&gt; and some of
the "top XX best hosting providers" sites. Two results kept showing up.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.server4you.com/"&gt;server4you&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tilaa.nl/"&gt;tilaa&lt;/a&gt;. Which one to choose then ? I wanted
to give both of them a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.server4you.com/"&gt;server4you&lt;/a&gt;. I really tried to buy a VPS
there and I failed. Lots of forms to fill and no instant money
transfer available. I entered my credit card details only to receive the
email after a day or so stating that they were unable to process my
payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tilaa.nl/"&gt;tilaa&lt;/a&gt;. What caught my attention there was
that clean website of them. I like such a design style, as you can also
see it here. Not so cheap, I must admit, but definitely easy to buy.
Payment transfered and after about a minute I had a full access to the
VPS. That's how I like things to work. I am using tilaa's the most
simple VPS plan since then and I am pretty happy with it. Here gathered
are some things I like or don't about its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;friendly, responsive staff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x RAM amount of swap space - seems great compared to no swap on
other VPSes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page"&gt;KVM&lt;/a&gt;+&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU"&gt;qemu&lt;/a&gt;
based, you get full control of your system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good overall system responsiveness - I experienced occasional lags
when using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page"&gt;OpenVZ&lt;/a&gt;
virtualization before, there's no such thing here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they work fast - the day the new Ubuntu 10.10 was released, they had
the VPS image ready !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their motto "We try to be good open source citizens" just convinces
me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only disadvantage is the price, it's 8.95 euro net montly, it's
also easy to miss that info on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I already have a safe place to tinker with my system the real work on
the server configuration begins. Stay tuned for the next episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>server</category><category>tilaa</category><category>ubuntu</category><category>virtualization</category><category>vps</category><guid>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2010/11/01/vps-adventures-part-two.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2010 14:23:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>VPS adventures part one</title><link>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2010/10/24/vps-adventures-part-one.html</link><dc:creator>Cyryl Płotnicki</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As every guy in the software industry I need ways to promote my humble
self. A decent web page and online resume plus a blog maybe are a must
these days. The question remains where to put them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I had my site published within one of the polish hosting
companies for free, as my friend was involved in its operations. Thanks
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kajetanwandowicz.com/"&gt;Kajetan&lt;/a&gt; for 5 years of support !
And maybe it'd stay that way if not of that desire of mine to tinker and
have control of every aspect of the technology power. Some platform with
ability to boot the system I want up would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real servers are good when you have a place to put them. And want to pay
electricity bills, provide UPS, KVM, BGP and other three-letter
abbreviations. And oh, I simply don't like the fan noise
anymore. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server"&gt;VPS&lt;/a&gt;
then it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I recently made contact with Ubuntu Server edition and liked it
for its simplicity, I started searching for a cheap VPS which supports
the newest Ubuntu. Two googles later I found
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dmehosting.com/"&gt;dmehosting.com&lt;/a&gt;. 6$ for 25Gigs of space
and 256MB RAM seemed ok, so I bougth the VPS1 plan. Payment went without
problems, they support PayPal. With 6$ less on my account I was waiting
for them to give me the IP + login &amp;amp; password. I didn't expect that I
would take the whole day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first contact with the machine was that of apt-get update, which
failed. Because of lack of network connectivity. I was logged by ssh to
that machine, so definitely some sort of connectivity had to be in
place. I dug into and found not working DNS servers, so I made VPS
connect to the other ones and everything started working. I jumped into
their 'live' tech support line just to hear that it was really bad of me
to change the resolv.conf and I just shouldn't do that. In the meanwhile
their DNSes went back so I in fact did revert the resolv.conf after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page"&gt;OpenVZ&lt;/a&gt;-based hosting, so
policy of "no-no's" is pretty much embedded in the very system. No
kernel reinstallation. No swap space. No system clock write access. No
clicking too fast in the administration panel. Never heard of such
virtualization platform property. Back to google then my search for VPS
is. Stay tuned for the next part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>dmehosting</category><category>server</category><category>ubuntu</category><category>virtualization</category><category>vps</category><guid>https://blog.cyplo.net/posts/2010/10/24/vps-adventures-part-one.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 23:40:32 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
