                <p>Today’s post is not a recipe at all. Maybe a little. More of viewpoint
than a recipe. Here’s what I think the tech recruitment should look
like. It won’t be cheap. And yes, I have conducted a lot of interviews
in my life. Start by describing the position. Who are you looking for,
what would they do for you, how would they bring money to your company.
Use words, not techie talk. I found most of the job descriptions online
do not match the real expectations of the employer. You just want a good
programmer, a person who thinks about what they does. It really doesn’t
matter if they know Haskell and you write in Erlang. I doesn’t matter if
they think in asm when you’re looking for Forth. I doesn’t matter if
they are Linux nerds and you’re Windows-only, if they know how a
computer works. As long as they think about what they do and know what’s
that for and agree with your goals, that’s perfectly fine. If you
translate your desire for a good programmer into a bulletpoint list of
tech words you dehumanize it. Don’t look for skillsets, look for people
I say. How to check whether someone is a good programmer then ? How to
score people against such a vague job description ? You don’t score
people I say, you just sort the set of people. I start by a rather loose
conversation. Tell me about the point in life you’re in, tell me
something about what fascinates you in the programming and finally
what’s your motivation for changing the job and why do you want to work
with us ? Somewhere in the middle I ask about the projects, what
technologies you do like, what not, why not. Do you feel comfortable
teaching others ? Then the talk gets momentum. We do focus on computers
finally, why should it slow down, really ? If someone is fascinated by
The Machines you should already noticed that, to be honest. Same with
boring people or annoying people. If you do not want to work with them
then do not hire them. Even if they’re brilliant. How does the computer
work then ? How does this happen that I have this text file full of
strange writings and suddenly they make the computer do stuff ? Why it’s
not a good idea to get the modern pc to fly a space shuttle ? What’s a
stack and what’s a heap ? Is the stack memory different from the heap
memory ? Why so. And the why. The most important question for me is the
mighty why. Not only should they understand how something works, but
more importantly why it works like that. I enjoy working with people who
are microwave-curious than the hex-feared ones. How does the microwave
oven heat things ? Does the DEADBEEF scare your ? Maybe it needs some
heat treatment then. Talk with people, make notes. What annoys you, what
impresses you. Do the exercises with them. Ask them how would they solve
a simple but a reallife problem. Design the solution with them. The more
lifelike the work scenario the better. Do the things you’d normally do
with your work colleague. And order the set of candidates. Work as the
simple max function. Take the first one and the second one,. Decide
which one seems better suited for you. Then take the next one and
compare her to the current max. And please hire people only when you’re
ready to hire them. UPDATE. After writing this post I've stumbled on
this <a class="reference external" href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2628-how-to-hire-a-programmer-when-youre-not-a-programmer">37signal's

<p>As some of you know Aptana is Eclipse. And Eclipse is a Java-based IDE
which means it's not particularly a speedy one. However if you have a
decent amount of ram, like 4gb, it's fairly easy to speed the Eclipse
up. Go ahead and find <strong>eclipse.ini</strong> or <strong>aptana.ini</strong> or other file which
contents look similar. These settings are from my Linux box, I know that
MacOS might be kinda scared by so high values, try lowering the Xmx
and/or others in such a case.</p>

</pre>
<p>These settings are for the 4gb ram box, try to find the ones which suit you best. MaxPermSize
stands for the maximum amount of the memory to be used by the Java
internals, Xms gives the amount of heap allocated on the VM start and
Xmx is the heap size limit. Start with upping Xms value as it's often
too small which causes the Java VM to make lots of heap resizes on the
app start.</p>

<p>It all started with my work assignment of installing MacOSX Server 10.6
on the XServe rack. Of course nothing went really well. The universe
keeps on picking up the most faulty scenarios for me, I think it's just
less boring. Briefly speaking, after debugging some hardware problem
with the CPU temperature meter I managed to install the base OSX server
system there. Hardware boy inside me is not amused with Apple's ideas
there. After that I needed to set up VMs with 10.6 64bit and 10.4 32bit
on top of that. Why so if already having 10.6 as the base system ?
Simply I wanted to avoid constant reinstallation of the base system, as
the machines are meant to be used for development and testing. Also the
XServe hardware was needed instead of classic blade system to meet Apple
license requirements. Having the internet read twice I decided to give
VirtualBox a try. My way of thinking was that I am already familliar
with that piece of software and know it as a easy to use one. In
addition to being pretty idiot-proof it also enables more enterprisely
features like operating from the commandline only. So what's the deal ?
Bring up VirtualBox GUI, click on new virtual machine creation button,
choose MacOSXServer, insert the iso file made from the installation dvd
and volia ? Not even remotely close. It appears that Apple has embedded
some kind of valid processors db into the system and checks the
processors present against it on every boot. Fine. But I am running this
thing on the Apple hardware. The only configuration I managed to install
and launch was single-core. Both 32 and 64bit guests seem to be working
fine. But what's the point of having many cores there if only one can be
used per a VM ? As with many other interesting problems I took it home.
Some time after that I found brilliant blog pair by
<a class="reference external" href="http://prasys.info/">prasys</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.nawcom.com/">nawcom</a>. It seems that the latter one
produces what's called <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.nawcom.com/?p=446">ModCD</a> which
allows booting with the processor checks disabled. Recipe for amd64:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>create new MacOSX vm in VirtualBox</li>
<li>change it to non-EFI type</li>
<li>boot ModCD</li>
<li>swap iso image for the one with the MacOS install</li>
<li>press f5</li>
<li>type -force64</li>
<li>press enter</li>
</ul>
<p>For me the installer crashed on the last step before reboot, but then it
rebooted successfully and continued on with the installation. Don't
forget to donate to nawcom if you can.</p>

                <p>Today's post is definitely not a tech one. Or maybe just a bit. It's
about blogging, from the other side of the keyboard. PEBKAC-style.
Fun-fact: Did you know that 'kac' in Polish means 'hangover' ? To the
point. I realised that I have dozens of posts in the state of started
but definitely not finished. Why is that so ? Is it that I am superbusy
with my new work ? Kinda. Is that that I am the guy responsible for the
installation of the sound system in one of the new Wrocław's clubs ?
Sounds pretty serious but still not a perfect excuse. The thing is that
there is no right excuse for not doing something you want to do. Do it
or don't. Don't pretend to. The funny thing is that the smallest
possible posts, like
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.cyplo.net/2011/01/29/netbeans-6-9-rails-3-ubuntu-10-10/">this</a>, brought me
the most views. I don't wanna loose you guys because I don't feel like
blogging recently. Mine unfinished tech posts won't probably make it
because I just don't remember what were these small tech tricks I used
to solve that problems. Not even wrote them down as I was so enlightened
by the superiority of my solutions. Don't do that. Take notes about
everything which you would possibly need and start working on the
sentences and wording. Rigth now. Go. Hit publish and let the world
know. Thanks go to

<p>I am a lazy person. I do like things to just work, run out of the box,
name it. I like Ubuntu for it's packaging system and ease of
installation of various software. However using Netbeans from the
default repo could cause you a headache when developing Rails 3 apps.
These just won't run. Let us start with installing the newest version of
the IDE</p>
<pre class="code console"><a name="rest_code_51addb35ab7c41d9991c19871d0958a1-1"></a><span class="go">sudo apt-get install netbeans</span>
<a name="rest_code_51addb35ab7c41d9991c19871d0958a1-2"></a><span class="gp">#</span><span class="k">then</span> go to the Tools-&gt;Plugins-&gt;Available and install all regarding Ruby
</pre>
<p>Now go ahead and try running some Rails app.</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_a33ccda08f7f4e85942c479b0a5141af-1"></a>/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.0.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:239:in `require': /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.0.3/lib/active_support/cache/mem_cache_store.rb:32: invalid multibyte escape: /[x00-x20%x7F-xFF]/ (SyntaxError)
</pre>
<p>you say ? Here's a quick fix</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_db88ab26046148fea934d2e7a66ff249-1"></a>#edit /usr/share/netbeans/6.9/etc/netbeans.conf
<a name="rest_code_db88ab26046148fea934d2e7a66ff249-2"></a>#=&gt; append -J-Druby.no.kcode=true to the the netbeans_default_options and volia
<a name="rest_code_db88ab26046148fea934d2e7a66ff249-3"></a># the whole line im my case goes like that:
<a name="rest_code_db88ab26046148fea934d2e7a66ff249-4"></a>netbeans_default_options="-J-client -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-XX:PermSize=32m -J-XX:MaxPermSize=200m -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -J-Dsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false -J-Druby.no.kcode=true"
</pre>
<p>Long term solution ? Wait for Netbeans 7.0 as the devs promised it to be fixed there</p>

progress last years, had <a class="reference external" href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>
forked from it and has some pretty good people working on it right now.
What more can I say.</p>

<p>After some not so pleasurable experiences with the previous VPS hosting
provider I started my search for some other one. This time not only
google was involved but also <a class="reference external" href="http://vark.com/">aardvark</a> and some of
the "top XX best hosting providers" sites. Two results kept showing up.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.server4you.com/">server4you</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tilaa.nl/">tilaa</a>. Which one to choose then ? I wanted
to give both of them a chance.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.server4you.com/">server4you</a>. I really tried to buy a VPS
there and I failed. Lots of forms to fill and no instant money
transfer available. I entered my credit card details only to receive the
email after a day or so stating that they were unable to process my
payment.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.tilaa.nl/">tilaa</a>. What caught my attention there was
that clean website of them. I like such a design style, as you can also
see it here. Not so cheap, I must admit, but definitely easy to buy.
Payment transfered and after about a minute I had a full access to the
VPS. That's how I like things to work. I am using tilaa's the most
simple VPS plan since then and I am pretty happy with it. Here gathered
are some things I like or don't about its services.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>friendly, responsive staff</li>
<li>2x RAM amount of swap space - seems great compared to no swap on
other VPSes</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a>+<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU">qemu</a>
based, you get full control of your system</li>
<li>good overall system responsiveness - I experienced occasional lags
when using <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page">OpenVZ</a>
virtualization before, there's no such thing here</li>
<li>they work fast - the day the new Ubuntu 10.10 was released, they had
the VPS image ready !</li>
<li>their motto "We try to be good open source citizens" just convinces
me</li>
<li>the only disadvantage is the price, it's 8.95 euro net montly, it's
also easy to miss that info on the site</li>
</ul>
<p>As I already have a safe place to tinker with my system the real work on
the server configuration begins. Stay tuned for the next episode.</p>

<p>As every guy in the software industry I need ways to promote my humble
self. A decent web page and online resume plus a blog maybe are a must
these days. The question remains where to put them.</p>
<p>Previously I had my site published within one of the polish hosting
companies for free, as my friend was involved in its operations. Thanks
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kajetanwandowicz.com/">Kajetan</a> for 5 years of support !
And maybe it'd stay that way if not of that desire of mine to tinker and
have control of every aspect of the technology power. Some platform with
ability to boot the system I want up would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Real servers are good when you have a place to put them. And want to pay
electricity bills, provide UPS, KVM, BGP and other three-letter
abbreviations. And oh, I simply don't like the fan noise
anymore. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>
then it is.</p>
<p>Since I recently made contact with Ubuntu Server edition and liked it
for its simplicity, I started searching for a cheap VPS which supports
the newest Ubuntu. Two googles later I found
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dmehosting.com/">dmehosting.com</a>. 6$ for 25Gigs of space
and 256MB RAM seemed ok, so I bougth the VPS1 plan. Payment went without
problems, they support PayPal. With 6$ less on my account I was waiting
for them to give me the IP + login &amp; password. I didn't expect that I
would take the whole day long.</p>
<p>My first contact with the machine was that of apt-get update, which
failed. Because of lack of network connectivity. I was logged by ssh to
that machine, so definitely some sort of connectivity had to be in
place. I dug into and found not working DNS servers, so I made VPS
connect to the other ones and everything started working. I jumped into
their 'live' tech support line just to hear that it was really bad of me
to change the resolv.conf and I just shouldn't do that. In the meanwhile
their DNSes went back so I in fact did revert the resolv.conf after all.</p>
<p>It's <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page">OpenVZ</a>-based hosting, so
policy of "no-no's" is pretty much embedded in the very system. No
kernel reinstallation. No swap space. No system clock write access. No
clicking too fast in the administration panel. Never heard of such
virtualization platform property. Back to google then my search for VPS
is. Stay tuned for the next part.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by works of Adrian Chmielarz, from the
times of Metropolis Software on. Naturally then, I am following really
closely on the development of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bulletstorm.com/">Bulletstorm</a>. Damn, I even hoped to
talk to The Guy or Mieszko Zielinski at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://gameaiconf.com/">gameaiconf</a> in Paris, but
<a class="reference external" href="http://aigamedev.com/">Alex</a> told me that "whoa,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.peoplecanfly.com/">PCF</a> is so busy with the new IP that
they didn't have time to come this year, next year they'll be here,
hopefully".</p>
<p>Having something so deeply embedded in your mind that you're always
thinking of it. While you eat, while you talk, in your sleep. That's the
way I do like to work. Reading about making of Bulletstorm gives me
creeps as I do feel their hyperenthusiasm about the thing, I do feel
that they take this game everywhere with them. To dinner, breakfast,
party. That's the way I do like to work.</p>
<p>Now back on track, an interview which triggered this urge to flush my
thoughts here. <a class="reference external" href="http://techland.com/2010/10/14/origins-tanya-jessen-lead-producer-on-bulletstorm/">Interview with Tanya
Jessen</a>,
producer at Epic.</p>

<p>It seems that being so much into other programming things I missed the
<a class="reference external" href="http://ai-contest.com/">Google AI Contest</a> announcement. It's
supercool that they sponsor such challenges but also it's really uncool
[so like warm ?] that apparently I won't have time to participate.</p>
<p>About the challenge itself - it involves working with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.galcon.com/fusion/">GalconFusion</a>-like game. Easy to
learn, difficult to master type. As they provide starter packs with a
sample bot it's easy to start. However, getting some decent place would
involve some really long time of good old hard work.</p>
<p>As a side note on .NET being spread around the unix world,  there's a C#
starter pack. Good. After few secs I realised that the code will be run
under antique <a class="reference external" href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.6/">Mono 1.2.6</a>,
therefore none of my young C# friends would be there. No type inference,
no linq, no other fancy stuff.  Not good.</p>
